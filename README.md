# Cosmology-2022--Project1
In this project, we explore the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, in the standard cosmological model, Λ-CDM, also known as the Benchmark model. We compute observable quantities in order to compare with observations, using cosmological parameters given by the Planck experiment, constants and graph references from the Barbara Ryden’s book, and data from supernova datasets. We present here the approximate results and those that did not fit the known model (many errors arose in the process and all of them are presented as part of the project).
